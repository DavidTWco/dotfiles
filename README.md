# dotfiles
dotfiles configuration managed by [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/). Originally created in Bash for Windows, has been tested on regular Ubuntu too.

## Current Issues (using Bash for Windows)
- In [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) and [Tmuxline](https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim), the backgrounds behind the Powerline sections aren't often filled in. Seems related to [bug #1463](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1463).
- [ConEmu](http://conemu.github.io/) currently works best, however [using this config](.ConEmu.xml), holding the arrow keys down for extended periods of time causes escape to be pressed. This seems to be related to [bug #1147](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1147).
