# dotfiles
dotfiles configuration managed by [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/). Originally created in Bash for Windows, has been tested on regular Ubuntu too.

## Current Issues (using Bash for Windows)
- [ConEmu](http://conemu.github.io/) currently works best, however [using this config](.ConEmu.xml), holding the arrow keys down for extended periods of time causes escape to be pressed.
- [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) currently doesn't work due to [bug #411](https://github.com/zplug/zplug/issues/411), has improved in recent releases.
